# CI Workflow

This repository contains a comprehensive Continuous Integration (CI) workflow designed to automate the testing, security scanning, and report generation for Node.js applications.

The pipeline integrates several OWASP tools to enhance the security and reliability of the application.

## Workflow Overview

The CI workflow is organized into several jobs, each responsible for a specific aspect of the CI process. The jobs include:

1. **Cache Dependencies**: Caches Node.js dependencies to speed up subsequent builds.
2. **Run Tests**: Executes unit and integration tests for the application.
3. **Run GitLeaks**: Scans the codebase for sensitive information leaks using GitLeaks.
4. **Run Nodejsscan**: Performs a security scan on Node.js code with Nodejsscan.
5. **Run Semgrep**: Analyzes the codebase for security issues using Semgrep.
6. **Run Retire.js**: Detects outdated or vulnerable JavaScript libraries with Retire.js.
7. **Build and Push with Trivy**: Builds a Docker image, scans it for vulnerabilities with Trivy, and pushes it to DockerHub.
8. **Upload Reports**: Collects and uploads all generated reports to a central location.

## Workflow Details

### Cache Dependencies

- **Purpose**: Cache Node.js dependencies to reduce build time.
- **Actions**:
  - Uses the `actions/cache` action to cache `node_modules`, `yarn.lock`, and `.yarn`.

### Run Tests

- **Purpose**: Run unit and integration tests.
- **Actions**:
  - Sets up Node.js environment.
  - Restores cached dependencies.
  - Installs necessary dependencies.
  - Runs Angular CLI commands and executes tests with Karma.
  - Runs server-side tests.

### Run GitLeaks

- **Purpose**: Detect sensitive information leaks in the codebase.
- **Actions**:
  - Uses Docker to run GitLeaks.
  - Generates a JSON report of findings.

### Run Nodejsscan

- **Purpose**: Perform a security scan on Node.js code.
- **Actions**:
  - Uses the `ajinaabraham/njsscan-action` to scan for vulnerabilities.
  - Outputs results in SARIF format.

### Run Semgrep

- **Purpose**: Analyze code for security issues.
- **Actions**:
  - Runs Semgrep in a container.
  - Outputs results in JSON format.

### Run Retire.js

- **Purpose**: Detect outdated or vulnerable JavaScript libraries.
- **Actions**:
  - Installs Retire.js and necessary dependencies.
  - Scans the codebase and outputs results in JSON format.

### Build and Push with Trivy

- **Purpose**: Build a Docker image, scan for vulnerabilities, and push the image to DockerHub.
- **Actions**:
  - Builds the Docker image.
  - Runs Trivy to scan for vulnerabilities.
  - Logs in to DockerHub and pushes the image.

### Upload Reports

- **Purpose**: Collect and upload all generated security and test reports.
- **Actions**:
  - Downloads all previously generated reports.
  - Uses a Python script to upload reports to a specified location.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Node.js
- Yarn
- Python 3.x
- GitHub Actions
